**Specializations Recommendation System for Laguna State Polytechnic University - College of Computer Studies**

Project Overview
The Specializations Recommendation System is designed to assist incoming third-year Information Technology students at Laguna State Polytechnic University - San Pablo City Campus in selecting a suitable specialization. 
This system uses assessment-based, grade-based (via content-based filtering), and preference-based recommendations powered by OpenAI. It aims to enhance academic performance, job satisfaction, and career opportunities for students, 
while also reducing the advising workload for faculty and administration.

Features
  - Assessment-Based Recommendations: Evaluate students' skills and interests to suggest suitable specializations.
  - Grade-Based Recommendations: Utilize content-based filtering to provide recommendations based on academic performance.
  - Preference-Based Recommendations: Incorporate OpenAI to factor in student preferences.
  - User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive and easy-to-use interface for both students and administrators.
  - Admin Dashboard: Manage student data, assessments, and view recommendation results.
